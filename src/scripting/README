This project is comet/space data extraction and analysis written in python (2.x). It takes a comet list and downloads
results based on which python scripts ran.
It should work properly provided as long as the file comet-list is provided and has the format explained later on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comet-list.ascii Format:

Line# CometCode/CometName RA DEC X Y /Year/Month/Day/f#/c#/p#/v#/fits image

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions:

- Some of the string parsed would generate a URL which is not found resulting in 404 error.

- Some comet names that are parsed do now follow certain format so I had to make special cases in regular exprestions.

- Instead of installing each an opener with the saved username and password, we can use cookies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries:

- datetime									(Built-in -  For logging)
- os										(Built-in -  Operating System calls)
- re 										(Built-in -  Regular Expression)
- urllib2									(Built-in -  To access the Web and data)
- name2codepoint 							(Built-in -  For HTML parsing)
- HTMLParser								(Built-in -  For HTML parsing)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies:

- wget 										(https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
- comet-list.ascii							(Found inside the zip)
- Username and Password						(Provided by Dr. Mouawad)

Note: All files have their own logger which wil be called "log-file name.txt" to keep track.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage: [Script Name].py

The user will be prompted for the username and password when needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transfer.py (Part 1.1)

- This python script will prompt for username and password.
- It will generate the links based on the naming as described in the document.
- It will create a Directory called "Space" and two subdirectories called "Fits" and "Ctlg".
- It will download refimgs and sexctlg files and store them with respect to their extension.
Note: It will also check for duplicates.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LinkGenerator.py (Part 1.2)

- This python script will prompt for username and password.
- It will generate the links based on the naming as described in the document.
- It will append the refimg and sexctlg for each link.
- It will store the links in a file called "links.txt" which is a dependancy for Downloader.py.
Note: It will also check for duplicates.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
links.txt Format:

URL

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Downloader.py (Part 1.2)

- This python script will prompt for username and password.
- It will access the links found in a folder called "links.txt".
- It will create a Directory called "Files" and two subdirectories called "Fits" and "Ctlg".
- It will use wget command to download the files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Output.py (Part 2)

- This python script will prompt for username and password.
- It will reformat the comet-list.ascii for Sarah's project.
- It will store the output in a file called "output.txt" formatted.
- It will displat the first refimg found and duplicates will be found inside the log.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.txt Format:

Line# CometCode/CometName X Y Range Original_fits_image Original_ctlg_image Reference_fits_image Reference_ctlg_image

Note: Reference are the downloaded images.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Descriptor.py (Part 3)

- This script will read each line in comet-list-ascii and obtain Data and Comet Name.
- It will get RA, DEC, and True Anomaly Angle from the horizon website(http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/).
- It will use the Horizon-batch interface which is a fetching data via data provided in the URL and request Data for each comet.
- It will create two files "comet-list1.ascii" and "comet-list2.ascii" since there will be two dates and stores in each respectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
comet-listx.ascii Format:

Line# CometCode/CometName Obtained_RA Obtained_DEC Original_RA Original_DEC X Y True_Anomaly_Angle /Year/Month/Day/f#/c#/p#/v#/fits image

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
log-x.txt Format:

[Data time] Description
